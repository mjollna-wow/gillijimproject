# gillijimproject
Attempt to convert alpha Wow WDT/ADT to LK (or even Cata) Adt format. Can also be used as base for other adt-related programs.

It's very messy, but you can have a look at main.cpp, comment/uncomment stuff in it, compile it and give the script some alpha xxx maps to work with, it should work.
Don't compile in debug mode though for big maps, it makes the conversion incredibly slow.
